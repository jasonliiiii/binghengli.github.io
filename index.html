            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Bingheng Li, but I also go by Jason. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Statistics and Computer Science, with an anticipated graduation in May 2025.</p>
            <p>My academic interests lie in analyzing large datasets and leveraging mathematical models and algorithms to address complex, real-world challenges. I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, and SQL, and am continuously expanding my technical skills to support my passion for data analysis and computational problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring various music genres, with hip-hop and indie rock being my favorites. In my free time, I often play games like League of Legends with friends and enjoy single-player games, including my recent favorite, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
